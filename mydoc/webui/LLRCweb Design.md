- [ ] No left side pane, since we display a lot of columns in both fileupload / OVT
- [ ] Create json file to demo or bug fix client side UI
- [ ] Server side completly separate by Ajax call..so, later Angular JS, can use if need
- [ ] identify to use mixin feature at middle of development
- [ ] Excel parsing at client side
- [ ] Dynamic class loading based on user role.
- [ ] User Never going to do both OVT and file upload at the same time. No MORE TABs
- [ ] Ignore excel's tab name validation, it going to do nothing with logic.
