1. __distribution__, easy to distrubute the application using __Grunt/Gulp__

## Selling/Selection factors

1. Dependency injection, so easy to unit testing any component ( not use "new" operator )
1. Directive, a reusable component
1. Module based organization of code
1. Layered architecture, to separate the concern like MVC
1. data handling for display by filters, expression and form validation using directives
1. two way data binding between model and view thats how avoid a lot of boiler plate code
1. **Compilation**, is the process, to traverse DOM tree by angular and looks for special kind of attribute/element
1. Use of Controller-as syntax to reduce direct use of $scope.
1. have many node.js based tool for dependency resolve, testing, delivery of application.
1. it protect the application against XSS  using ng-bind-html
