# Comparision between IDEA and other editors

 1. Context senstive ( rather than workaround/ install separate plugin )

    a. Easy enable /disable plugin

    b. Easy to share/re-use IDEA settings accross version

    c. tool bar icon, for settings.

    d. ask to add to git, when creating new files.

    e. tree view of modified files while git commit

    f. Project Tool view with many sub-view by dropdown rather than many view.

    g. Module icon color in project tool window.

    h. Now, single LLR project with many modules ( LLRCWeb, Calculator, Documentations )

    i. because of module concept, we no need many workspace for any reason

    j. class and package creation using single text box entry.

    k. Content assistence in code template. awesome ( live template )

    l. Run configuration - temporary. it is not like eclipe would create many run configuration permanantly


 2. One project, but *many module support*.

 3. Extensive support Android
 4. Extensive support for JavaScript
